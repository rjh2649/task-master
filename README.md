# TaskMaster

Individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often struggle with managing their daily tasks and maintaining focus on priorities. Despite recognizing the importance of task management, many find it challenging to effectively organize their time and activities, leading to stress, procrastination, and feelings of overwhelm. This project hopes to address these challenges by featuring priority-based task scheduling, allowing users to create personalized schedules aligned with their goals. Users earn points as they complete tasks, which can be exchanged for pre-selected recreational activities/break time.

As someone with ADHD, I find myself struggling to get things done in timely fashion, no matter how much I want to get them done. With TaskMaster, I'm hoping to create something that works for me, as well as anyone else who struggles with executive dysfunction.
